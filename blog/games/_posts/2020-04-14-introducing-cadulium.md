Cadulium is a mystery science fiction action adventure video game that follows the stories of Maia and Maria.

Maia is being followed and she doesn't know why.  She struggles for survival while trying to solve her mystery.

Maria works at "the University", and she is also part of the story.

Cadulium has a similar story as Target of Desire and Target of Desire: Epsiode 1.  It has the same characters: Maia and Maria, but their look has changed.

Cadulium will be longer and have more action in the video game than Target of Desire.  It might also be a book, but the book would have a different title.

Cadulium will be the first game/book in a series, just like Target of Desire.
