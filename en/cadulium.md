# Cadulium

What happens when a video game character is self-aware?

Cadulium follows the stories of Maia and Maria.

Maia is a video game character who is followed by men in suits everywhere she goes, and she doesnâ€™t know why. She fights for survival while trying to solve her mystery and understand her reality.

Maria is a cryptic character. She "works at the University." She blogs (and is on social media) under the username of IamNamedMaria, where she speculates about the nature of reality.
