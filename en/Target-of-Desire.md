What happens when a video game character is self-aware?

Target of Desire follows the stories of Maia and Maria.

Maia is a video game character who is followed by men in suits everywhere she goes, and she doesn't know why. She fights for survival while trying to solve her mystery and understand her reality.

Maria is a cryptic character. She 'works at the University.' She blogs (and is on social media) under the username of IamNamedMaria, where she speculates about the nature of reality.
